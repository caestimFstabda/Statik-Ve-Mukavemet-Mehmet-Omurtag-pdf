 Statik Ve Mukavemet Mehmet Omurtag.pdf: A Book Review 
Statik Ve Mukavemet Mehmet Omurtag.pdf is a digital version of the book Statik Ve Mukavemet, which was written by Mehmet Omurtag, a professor of civil engineering at Istanbul Technical University. The book is a comprehensive and updated textbook on the topics of statics and strength of materials, which are essential for engineering students and professionals. The book covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject, with numerous examples, exercises, and applications. The book is divided into two parts: statics and strength of materials.
 
## Statics
 
The first part of the book deals with statics, which is the branch of mechanics that studies the equilibrium of forces acting on rigid bodies. The book starts with an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of statics, such as force, moment, equilibrium, free-body diagrams, and coordinate systems. The book then proceeds to discuss various types of forces and their effects on rigid bodies, such as concurrent forces, parallel forces, coplanar forces, non-coplanar forces, distributed forces, friction forces, and internal forces. The book also covers the topics of trusses, frames, machines, cables, arches, and beams. The book provides a clear and systematic presentation of the methods and techniques for analyzing the equilibrium of rigid bodies under different conditions and constraints.

## Strength of Materials
 
The second part of the book deals with strength of materials, which is the branch of mechanics that studies the behavior of deformable bodies under external loads. The book starts with an introduction to the basic concepts and principles of strength of materials, such as stress, strain, elasticity, plasticity, Hooke's law, Poisson's ratio, thermal effects, and strain energy. The book then proceeds to discuss various types of stresses and strains and their effects on deformable bodies, such as axial stress and strain, shear stress and strain, torsional stress and strain, bending stress and strain, buckling stress and strain, combined stress and strain, and principal stress and strain. The book also covers the topics of beams, columns, shafts, springs, pressure vessels, thin-walled structures, thick-walled structures, and composite materials. The book provides a detailed and rigorous presentation of the methods and techniques for analyzing the deformation and failure of deformable bodies under different loads and conditions.
 
## Conclusion
 
Statik Ve Mukavemet Mehmet Omurtag.pdf is a valuable and authoritative resource for engineering students and professionals who want to learn or review the fundamentals of statics and strength of materials. The book is written in a clear and concise language, with a logical and consistent structure. The book is rich in examples, exercises, applications, figures, tables, charts, graphs, diagrams, and formulas.
